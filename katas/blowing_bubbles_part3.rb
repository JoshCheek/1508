# Haven't decided if I want to actually make this yet

# Part 3:
# Starting with the class-style one:
#   swap order
#   spaceship operator
#   blocks

# Part 4 maybe?

#   * Round 1: Complete "part 1"
#   * Round 2: Complete "part 2"
#   * Round 3: Time yourself on "part 1",
#     then practice until you can complete it in half that time
#     (hint: if you have one that was particularly slow,
#     it is more effective to do this one several times in a row
#     than to only practice it in the midst of the others which are easier for you)
#   * Round 4: Time yourself on "part 2",
#     then practice until you can complete it in half that time.
#   * Round 5: Complete "part 1" with no mistakes
#     (each one runs successfully the first time you run it).
#     You may use 2 "save spots".
#     Example: if you complete the first 4 challenges without a mistake,
#     but feel uncomfortable with the 5th,
#     then you can use one of your save spots before beginning the 5th.
#     This means that if you make any mistakes as you do the rest of them,
#     that you have to start over at challenge 5 rather than challenge 1.
#   * Round 6: Complete "part 1" in ? minutes.
#     Pay attention to what is costing the most time.
#     * Is it your typing speed?
#       Then practice typing between each one (I use Type Fu, you can buy it in the App store).
#     * Is it some particular type of editing? Then analyze that editing skill, come up with a
#       series of keystrokes that addresses it well, and practice them until that part of the
#       problem isn't holding you back. Eg if you need to indent 3 lines, and it's expensive to
#       go to the front of the line, indent, go to the next line, indent, etc, then analyze/google,
#       and create a plan like "hold shift, press C-n/down twice",
#       and then indent the whole block at once with `Command+]`
#     * Is it how some particular piece of refactoring works?
#       Then practice that one refactoring 5 times (do/undo/do/undo/do/undo/do/undo/do/undo)
#   * Round 7: Complete "part 2" in ? minutes.
